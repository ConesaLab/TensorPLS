# TensorPLS

An R package for exploring patterns in three-way omics data using N-PLS-DA.

## Why TensorPLS?

Multi-omics and longitudinal studies often generate data with a natural **multi-way structure**  
(e.g., *subjects × features × time* or *subjects × features × omics blocks*).

## Core questions addressed by TensorPLS

When applying N-PLS-DA with TensorPLS, you can answer:

1. **Is the model able to discriminate groups?**  

2. **Which variables/features mostly contribute to group discrimination?**  

3. **Is the model able to predict outside the sample (Q²)?**  

4. **How much variation is captured (R²)?**  

5. **Which time points or blocks contribute most?**
